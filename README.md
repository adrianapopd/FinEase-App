# FinEase-App
FinEase is a banking web application that allows the user to manage their bank account, created on the basis of username and pin. <br>
Implementation (technologies used): <br>
• HTML: The user interface is created based on HTML elements, using semantic tags to increase the functionality efficiency; <br>
• CSS: Styling the application for a modern look, by choosing harmonious color palettes, suggestive fonts from the Google Fonts API, animations, pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes; <br>
• JavaScript: The use of  Internationalization API, as long as modern programming techniques such as "Functional Programming" (using the "map", "filter", "reduce" methods), respectively the declarative syntax (using the "ternary operator" or "template literals") , but also opting for structuring in Modules, for code encapsulation, abstraction and reuse. <br>
Extra notes: Included Parcel 2 & polyfilling for Modules bundling + Responsive Mobile Design <br>
